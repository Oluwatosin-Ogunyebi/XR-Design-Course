Demo Scene
Sample scene of different interactions that students can play with and try to deconstruct on their own time.

====
Sandbox Scene
This is an area for students to practice whatever they like.

====
Finished Scene
This is the final version of the project with all functionality we're covering in class.

====
Unfinished Scene
I've removed the following from the Unfinished scene. You'll need to walk through adding and hooking up the functionality for the following...

- XR rig and XRI manager
- All teleportation areas, anchors and surface rigidbodies
- All locomotion systems
- All XR socket interactor and collider components on the sockets
- All XR Grab Interactable, rigidbodies, and colliders from bowling balls
- XR Simple Interactable from the ResetButtonHover game object
- UI panel for ChooseSceneUI and Event System
- Ball Cam Texture material from the BallCamScreen
- Ball Camera

Also, all environment "scenes" for Choose a Scene functionality are deactivated
